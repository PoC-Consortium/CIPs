## Abstract

Anchoring so called real-world data in the Burst blockchain is
essential to get an interface between the blockchain and the world
outside of the blockchain. If the blockchain could record external
data in it's inherently decentral trustless consensus way, this would
open a whole plethora of possible applications most cryptocurrencies
will never be able to do.

Recording e.g. sensor data would enable a decentral, resilient and
trusted storage for archiving purposes, chain of custody proofs or
decentral validation and analysis.

## Motivation

Getting real world data anchored in the blockchain reliably is
surprisingly hard, which is probably why to the best of our knowledge
no other cryptocurrency does it at protocol level.

The problems are manifold. Let's say we would like to store the
current temperature in New York in our blockchain. How can we
algorithmically decide which value is "correct"? If all nodes of the
network would retrieve that information from one data point, then they
might all get "the value" (provided these nodes do not DDoS that data
point, provided it does not send various values to various IPs and
provided it is not down already) and actually be able to get a
consensus on that.

However, if the initial data source is a central/single entity, then
putting that data into a decentral trustless consensus network is
moot. It's like making something out of nothing. If this central data
point became corrupted (technical problem or bad actor), then the
whole consenus network would be duped.

This makes it clear, that decentral consenus data can only come from
decentral data. This may put some data off limits, but plenty of
interesting data remain.

In order to be able to implement "Tethered Assets" (see
[[cip-0011.md|CIP11 Tethered Assets]]), the most interesting of
these data are tickers from exchanges (regular and crypto) and central
banks.

## Specification

### RWFDS Format

In this CIP, we propose a "real world fiscal data section" (RWFDS) to
be stored within each block of the blockchain. This should be a
simple, fixed length key-value format denoting values of certain
currencies and commodities in Burst (more precisely: in Planck). The
total size of the block could be a modest 1024 byte, which would leave
us space for 64 key value pairs and each key could have up to 8
(ASCII)-bytes identifiers.

    00000USD:000XXXXX
    00000EUR:000YYYYY
    001g Aur:000ZZZZZ

The '0' are to be understood as padding 0-bytes, the ':' is just for
visualization purposes, not existant in the real data.

### Data Source Requirements

In order to be stored in a blockchain (decentral trustless
consensus-based storage) the originating data has to meet certain
properties:

* several independent and reliable data sources
* other consumers depend on the validity of this data too
* sufficient redundancy, so a temporary failure of some sources can be compensated

Independence:

Preferably we do not fetch real world data from source X and Y, where
e.g. source Y fetches its data from X too. We may use dependent
sources as a means of access redundancy or load balancing for the
nodes in the Burst network, but not as means of data redundancy.

Reliability:

The data source must have a record of reliability and uptime as well
as scalability (able to sustain traffic the Burst network may impose
on it). Also, we should make sure the Burst network retrievals are ok
with the operator and not seen as some form of DDoS.

Non-Exclusiveness:

Other consumers apart from the Burst network also depend on the
data. This way we make sure disruption of the service motivates also
other interest groups to work towards restoring the service.

Redundancy:

Outage of M out of N data sources does not disrupt Burst RWDS building
operation.


### Node Behavior At Source Failure

In order to ensure consensus, but to prevent excessive forking events
in the case of failures, each single node in the Burstcoin network has
to adhere to the following principles:

* if a data source becomes unavailable, assume value of the past block
* if the value change of retrieved data exceeds the variance of past N blocks, assume value of the past block
* if any of the adverse events above happens, do not use the data to sign/validate a block, but only to validate data from the majority of nodes claiming to have genuine RWFDS content

If no node majority can be found, use the last RWFDS that had consensus. (Ultimate Fallback)

## Abstract

POC2 format plots is consisting of interleaved SHABAL256 hashes and
it will prevent time-memory tradeoff for high-range scoops.

## Motivation

Now with the current PoC used with Burstcoin, there indeed are
time-memory tradeoffs possible.  This attack on PoC mining fairness
was possible in theory, but not feasible economically, because the PoW
required for this mode of operation consumed far more energy than a
PoC mining style.

However recent advancements in hardware and GPU performance do show,
that economical feasibility is just a matter of time.

## Specification

The POC2 nonce format is created the same way as when we create POC1
with a slight addition to the end of the process. To create a POC2
formatted nonce we need to shuffle the data around. If we divide the
nonce in 2 halves we get a range with scoops 0-2047 and
2048-4095. Let’s call 0-2047 the low scoop range and 2048-4095 the
high scoop range. To shuffle the data into correct place we take the
second hash from a scoop in the low range and swap it with the second
hash in its mirror scoop found in the high range. The mirror scoop is
calculated like this:

```
MirrorScoop = 4095 – CurrentScoop
```

### Compatibility

This is a hard forking change, thus breaks compatibility with old
fully-validating node. It should not be deployed without widespread
consensus.
